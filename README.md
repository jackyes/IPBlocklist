    `yum install wget`  
  On Debian:  
    `apt install wget` 
* **iprange**  
  On RHEL/CentOS:  
    `yum install autoconf automake make`  
    `yum groupinstall "Development tools"`  
  On Debian:  
    `apt install autoconf automake make build-essential` 
  
  On both:      
    `git clone https://github.com/firehol/iprange.git`  
    `cd iprange`  
    `./autogen.sh`    
    `./configure --disable-man && make && make install`    
    



#Usage:  
  
Modify BASE and FOLDER_BL variabile or create /etc/sysconfig folder in your system (`mkdir /etc/sysconfig`) 
  
Save your iptables rules (will be reloaded each blocklist update):  
`iptables-save > /root/iptables.save`  
Edit the script config section acordingly to your needs. (ex. location of iptables and ipset, wich blocklist to use, etc..)  
`./CreateBlocklist.sh`  
Optional:  
Add it to cron `crontab -e`  
(Is suggested to create copy of your iptables rules and reset it before running this script, use `iptables-save` and `iptables-restore`)  
Add this line:  
`30 2 * * * sh /path/to/script/CreateBlocklist.sh > /path/to/script/Create.log`  
Execute the script at 2.30 AM everyday and save output to /path/to/script/Create.log
